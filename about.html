         <h3>Ziggy Stone was born in Wichita, Kansas.  He started playing the ukelele with his grandmother, while his sister sang and his brother played the  harmonica. "Many days were spent sitting in my backyard, the slow summer breeze hitting my face and the mist of the nearby river would set the romantic stage of heroes and swashbucklers, giving me a dream of one day singing songs of the people like Bob Dylan."
